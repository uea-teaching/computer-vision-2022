- Camera Model
- Intrinsic and Extrinsic Parameters
- Direct Linear Transformation

::: notes
We have talked a lot about images, but not much on how we obtain images using a camera.
We will discuss the parameters of a pinhole camera model,
that serves well for computer vision tasks.
In the first part - we will then show the relationship between points in the world and points in the image.

# The Camera

!["Sallie Gardner," owned by Leland Stanford; ridden by G. Domm, running at a 1:40 gait over the Palo Alto track, 19th June 1878.](assets/jpg/horse.jpg){width="80%"}

::: notes
who would disagree if I said the camera was one of the most important inventions in the history of science?
Here Edweard Muybridge shows definitively that a horses feet al leave the ground when galloping.

## The Camera {data-auto-animate="true"}

Cameras measure light **intensities**.

- the sensor counts photons arriving at the pixel
- each pixel corresponds to a direction in world space

::: notes
What do cameras measure?
:::

## The Camera {data-auto-animate="true"}

Cameras can also be seen as _direction_ measurement devices.

- we are often interested in geometric properties of a scene
- an object reflects light to a specific location on the sensor
- Which 3D point is mapped to which pixel?

::: notes
light falls on an object, is reflected back to the camera, and then to a pixel.
which position on the sensor?
